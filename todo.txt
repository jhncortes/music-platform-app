Things to do:
- Fix home page - show all users tracks - DONE
- Edit profile feature (allow users to edit name, upload profile pic, bio etc)
- Put in privileges/authorization (Can delete upload own tracks, edit their profile)
- make settings page -> edit profile

- change naming conventions from userId to user_id etc
- 

Create table called profile
when creating an account, fill the profile table with default blank




Later:
- Filter option
- Search feature
- Timestamps on tracks


Bugs:
- Weird bug where user can access /home if backend api is down ( fix routing )
